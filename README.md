- 👋 Hi, I’m @ddsmith501

- 🌱 I’m currently struggling with y Windows 11 host and getting access to the web interface (I did select the so-allow during installation)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the missing compnent as to why I cannot gain web access
- 📫 How to reach me via email at ddsmith501@gmail.com

I have enterered the so-allow command of the IP of 192.168.57.0/24 and the static address I assined during the Create a new Virtual Machine in VMware
I have two interfaces - one for internert and one for management.
Internet adapter is set to NAT
The management port is set to Bridged and Replicate is checked 
Both have the Connected and Connect on poer checked
The ip and url do resolve i.e. https://sos-eval does equal 192.168.57.140 and vice versa
I have not been able to access from the VM or from the host laptop with either chrome or firefox
I have read documnetation about the so-allow for the IP address
Firewall to open port 8080 and add port for osquery - fail
This is were I am stuck and looking for help.
